# Songs to help ingrain music intervals
Identifying intervals is the first step to unlocking great ears, and associating intervals with songs is the first step to identifying intervals.

Here's a page I built for such songs: [Go To the Page](http://github.com).

By the way 1, after training your ears for a while, internalize these intervals without the help of a song! You don't want to be imagining the Jaws theme everytime a minor 2nd shows up!

By the way 2, Earpeggio is a good app on iPhone to train your interval idenfication skills, it also have melody dictation, scale identification, etc.

Good luck!
